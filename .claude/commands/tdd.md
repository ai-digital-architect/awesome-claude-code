Test-Driven Development workflow for: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:

1. **Write Failing Tests**
   - Write comprehensive tests for the feature
   - Cover happy path and edge cases
   - Include error conditions
   - Run tests and verify they fail correctly

2. **Implement Minimal Code**
   - Write just enough code to pass tests
   - Keep implementation simple
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Run tests frequently

3. **Refactor**
   - Clean up implementation
   - Improve code structure
   - Ensure tests still pass
   - Update documentation

4. **Review**
   - Verify all tests pass
   - Check test coverage
   - Review code quality
   - Update CLAUDE.md if needed

Report on test results and implementation progress.
