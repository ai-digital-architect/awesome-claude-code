   - Scalability requirements
   - Accessibility standards
   - Browser/platform support

5. **Dependencies**
   - External services
   - Libraries and frameworks
   - Infrastructure requirements

6. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit test requirements
   - Integration test scenarios
   - E2E test cases

7. **Acceptance Criteria**
