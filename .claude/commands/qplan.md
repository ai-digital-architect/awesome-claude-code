Analyze similar parts of the codebase and determine whether your plan:

1. **Consistency Check**
   - Is consistent with existing architecture patterns
   - Follows established naming conventions
   - Uses existing utilities and helpers where applicable

2. **Minimal Changes**
   - Introduces the minimum necessary changes
   - Avoids unnecessary refactoring
   - Preserves existing functionality

3. **Code Reuse**
   - Identifies existing code that can be reused
   - Avoids duplication
   - Leverages established patterns

4. **Impact Analysis**
   - Lists all files that will be modified
   - Identifies potential side effects
   - Notes any breaking changes

Present your analysis before proceeding with implementation.
